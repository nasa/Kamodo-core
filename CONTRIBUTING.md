## Creating Issues

For bugs, open an issue in GitHub.

For features, provide enough context to illustrate the intended use case. If possible, include a test function that should pass once the feature is considered complete.


## Developer setup

Clone the git repo and install kamodo in developer mode: from the base of the repo:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

!!! note
    If you add any files while in editor mode, make sure they will be picked up by the MANIFEST.in file.

Kamodo is cross-platform, so you should be able work on whatever developing environment is convenient for you.
However, we find it helpful to mount the code into a docker container and we provide a docker-compose.yaml. This causes the least disruption with your machine and makes it easier to deploy Kamodo containers to cloud services.
If you have installed docker with docker `compose`, you can spin up a developer environment with one line from the base of the repo:

```sh
docker compose up
```


## Creating a Pull Request

### Branching

First create a branch off of `master`, named after the feature or issue you are targeting.

```sh
git checkout -b issue-999
```

You may start your PR when you prefer, depending on how much support you'll need to complete it, but remember it should be up-to-date with `master` before it can be merged.


### Testing

Run tests locally prior to pushing.

```sh
python -m pip install flake8 pytest
pip install pytest-cov
```

Then, from the base of the git repo

```sh
pytest --cov kamodo.kamodo --cov kamodo.util --cov plotting kamodo/test_plotting.py kamodo/test_kamodo.py kamodo/test_utils.py
```

Try to at least maintain the current code coverage with your PR.

### Generating Docs

Kamodo's documentation site is a good example of how to embed your own plots in your own website.
The documentation site is generated by the `mkdocs` package with some addons

* mkdocs - handles site generation and deployment (configured by top-level `mkdocs.yaml`)
* markdown-include - allows for embedding of markdown files (and graph divs) outside the docs folder
* python-markdown-math - enables LaTeX rendering
* mknotebooks - allows for the embedding of jupyter notebooks

All of the above requirements can be installed with this line:

```console
pip install mkdocs python-markdown-math markdown-include mknotebooks
```

You can then generate the docs and serve locally with

`mkdocs serve`

To deploy your own documentation on github-pages:

`mkdocs gh-deploy`

This generates a gh-pages branch with the static site files and pushes it to github. Github automatically creates a website url based on that branch.


### Releasing

Kamodo uses calendar versioning via [incremental](https://pypi.org/project/incremental/):

```sh
pip install incremental
```

To update the package

```sh
cd kamodo # navigate from base of repo into package
python -m incremental.update versioning # assigns a new (calender) version number within module 
# python -m incremental.update versioning --rc # for release candidate
git add versioning # stage version update
hourly commit.message="version update, other features here" # commit version update (optional)
cd .. # navigate back to base of repo
pip install -e . # update local version
git tag version_number_here # create new tag
git push origin version_number_here # triggers pypi update (requires adequate github permissions)
```

### Upgrading

New versions of kamodo's dependencies will require periodic updates to the
core package. The following steps should be followed to keep this package maintained.

1. Update github workflow
1. Create dockerfile
1. Update docker-compose.yml
1. Update setup.cfg
1. Update pypi package

#### Update github workflow

In the base of this repo `.github/workflows/kamodo-package.yml`, edit the jobs section to
reflect the inteded versions of python to support

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.7', '3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
```

Whenever a commit is pushed to this repo, all of the listed python versions will be tested.
If any errors show up, this will reveal any changes we need so that all tests pass.

#### Create dockerfile

Builds with different base dependencies (such as python versions) require their own docker files.
This allows developers to develop and test changes locally. Add the build to `dockerfiles/<build-name>.Dockerfile`. For example, an appropriate image for python 3.11 is in `dockerfiles/kamodo-py311.Dockerfile`.

#### Update docker-compose

Include runtime parameters for your upgrade in `docker-compose.yml`. For example, the following docker compose service can be run like this

```sh
docker compose up kamodo-py311 # builds and hosts a python-3.11 kamodo notebook server at localhost:8888
```

```yaml
  kamodo-py311:
    image: ensemble/kamodo-py311
    platform: linux/arm64/v8 # aarch64-linux-gnu
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: dockerfiles/kamodo-py311.Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ${PWD}
        target: /kamodo
    command:
      - jupyter
      - notebook
      - /kamodo
      - --port=8888
      - --no-browser
      - --ip=0.0.0.0
      - --allow-root
```


### Hourly (optional)

Consider using [hourly](https://github.com/asherp/hourly) for time tracking your branch. This will allow future developers to see which parts of the code receive the most attention. 

If you're using hourly, you'll want to configure `hourly.yaml` so that your worklog points to a file named after you:

```yaml
work_log:
  header_depth: 3
  filename: worklogs/my_github_username.md
```
